Things To Do:

Faulty zfs pools should be marked in red

The tree cell renderers don't actually do tooltips

Solaris 11 port (whatever information needs to be different)

Nothing actually calls SysItem.setStatus()

Update arcstat

top: jkstat + jproc; graphical charts and sparks for summaries; add
zone/user/whatever aggregation

ZFS: need to display snapshots

Handle metadevices used for swap.

Should Mnttab be singleton?
Would make it easier to query from any context without having to
pass around.

Mnttab should update itself to allow for mount and unmount activity

Can we save historical kstat data so that the charts don't start blank
each time?

threaded cores and individual threads should show their fragment of the
psrinfo output

threads and cores should say what their parent is

Possible bug: seen a NoSuchElementException parsing Mnttab

Localize explorer

In services view, parent nodes should inherit the status of their
children (done, needs checking more widely)
