Solaris zones confuse solview somewhat:

Of the informational commands, prtconf, prtpicl, and prtdiag don't
work; share is meaningless; there's no local routing; it's pointless
giving a zone list.


Solaris bug:

Yes Peter? routeadm
routeadm: failed to open /etc/inet/routing.conf: Permission denied

(there's no such file...)
